# Pomodoro App

This is a simple Pomodoro app created using HTML, CSS, and React. The app is designed to help users manage their time effectively and increase productivity by using the Pomodoro Technique.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app allows users to set a timer for work sessions and breaks, helping them stay focused and motivated.

## Features

- Timer: The app provides a countdown timer that automatically switches between work sessions and breaks according to the Pomodoro Technique. The default work session is set to 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four work sessions, a longer break of 15 minutes is triggered.

- Start, Pause, and Reset: Users can start, pause, and reset the timer as needed. This provides flexibility in managing work sessions and breaks according to individual preferences.
